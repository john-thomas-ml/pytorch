# PyTorch Learning Repository

Welcome to the PyTorch Learning Repository!  
This repository is a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to deepen your understanding of PyTorch and its applications in deep learning.  
Each notebook focuses on a specific concept or project, providing hands-on experience and practical insights.

## üìÅ Contents

- **`basics.ipynb`**: An introduction to PyTorch fundamentals, including tensors, operations, and basic neural network structures.
- **`linear-regression.ipynb`**: Implementation of linear regression using PyTorch, covering data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
- **`mnist.ipynb`**: A project focused on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a simple neural network.
- **`cifar10.ipynb`**: Image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, demonstrating the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PyTorch.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore and run the notebooks:

1. **Clone the repository**:
